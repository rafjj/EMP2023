Code I wrote for a group project at Politecnico di Torino, for a class about Models and methods of climate change. 
The script is scraping data from public databases and it tries to verify whether or not periods of siccity correlates with a decrease in rice production in the region of Piedmont, analyzing a the timeframe 2002-2022, as those were the available and compatible datasets at the time I worked on it. 
This code was part of a bigger project, involving various methods of analysis of a problem like this, however, the credit for that work is shared among group members and professors, therefore I will not post them here.
